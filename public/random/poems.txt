Sometimes I poo,
I love you too.

She was a little tense,
The notice made no sense.

I saw a little hermit crab,
His coloring was oh so drab.

It's hard to see the butterfly,
Because he flies across the sky.

Hear the honking of the goose,
I think he's angry at the moose.

His red sports car is just a dream,
It needs no gas, it runs on steam.

The children like the ocean shore,
We want to leave but they want more.

I made the cookies one by one,
I hear the bell, so they are done.

My cat, she likes to chase a mouse,
Especially one that's in the house.

Lightening, thunder, all around,
Soon the rain falls on the ground.

I tire of writing poems and rhyme,
I think I need vacation time.

Jack be nimble, Jack be quick,
Jack jump over the candlestick.

Be not the first by whom the new are tried,
Nor yet the last to lay the old aside.

Tis education forms the common mind,
Just as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined.

O could I flow like thee, and make thy stream,
My great example, as it is my theme.

Time and Death shall depart, and say in flying,
Love has found out a way to live, by dying.

So, lovers dream a rich and long delight,
But get a winter-seeming summer's night.

The time is out of joint, O cursed spite,
That ever I was born to set it right.

This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
To beautify him only lacks a cover.

Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind,
And therefore is winged Cupid painted blind.

For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds,
Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.

Thus have I had thee as a dream doth flatter,
In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.
